## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wvpssriraj10/CricketSense-An-AI-Powered-Cricket-Match-Summary-Generator.git
   cd CricketSense-An-AI-Powered-Cricket-Match-Summary-Generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python cricsense_match_summary.py
   ```

## 🗂️ Data Setup

This app expects SA20 match CSVs in a local folder named `data/sa20 data/` inside the project.

- Place your match CSV files in: `data/sa20 data/`
- Expected filename pattern (case-insensitive):

  - `match <id>; <Team A> vs <Team B>; <year>; <optional match type>; <1st/2nd innings>.csv`

  Examples:
  ```
  match 12345; MI Cape Town vs Sunrisers Eastern Cape; 2023; 1st innings.csv
  match 12345; MI Cape Town vs Sunrisers Eastern Cape; 2023; 2nd innings.csv
  match 67890; Pretoria Capitals vs Joburg Super Kings; 2023; Final; 1st innings.csv
  match 67890; Pretoria Capitals vs Joburg Super Kings; 2023; Final; 2nd innings.csv
  ```

Notes:
- If innings is not specified in the filename, the app attempts to infer it from the CSV content.
- The app reads columns like `batting_team`, `runs_off_bat`, `extras`, `player_dismissed`/`wicket_type`/`is_wicket`, and `ball`.
- If `start_date`/`state_date`/`date` is present, it will be used for display.

## 📋 Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Browse through available matches
3. Select a match to view its AI-generated summary
4. Explore detailed statistics and key moments

### Command-line

Basic interactive usage:

```bash
python cricsense_match_summary.py
```

Notes:
- The app is interactive and shows a numbered list of matches discovered in `sa20 data/`.
- Choose a number to view a summary, or `q` to quit.
- Narratives vary slightly between runs to keep the descriptions fresh.

### Non-Interactive and Export

List matches (no export):

```bash
python cricsense_match_summary.py --non-interactive --data-dir "data/sa20 data"
```

Print a single match summary by ID:

```bash
python cricsense_match_summary.py --non-interactive --match-id 12345 --data-dir "data/sa20 data"
```

Export one or all matches:

```bash
# Single match to JSON
python cricsense_match_summary.py --non-interactive --match-id 12345 --export-json out.json --data-dir "data/sa20 data"

# Single match to CSV
python cricsense_match_summary.py --non-interactive --match-id 12345 --export-csv out.csv --data-dir "data/sa20 data"

# All matches to both JSON and CSV
python cricsense_match_summary.py --non-interactive --export-json summaries.json --export-csv summaries.csv --data-dir "data/sa20 data"
```

Available flags:

- `--data-dir`: Directory containing match CSV files (default: `data/sa20 data`)
- `--non-interactive`: Run without the UI; list or output summaries
- `--match-id`: With `--non-interactive`, target a single match ID
- `--export-json PATH`: Write summaries to a JSON file
- `--export-csv PATH`: Write summaries to a CSV file
- `--log-level LEVEL`: Logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`)

## 🧪 Sample CSVs (Minimal Examples)

Create these two files inside `sa20 data/` to quickly test the app. These are minimal columns the app uses.

File: `data/sa20 data/match 1001; Team A vs Team B; 2023; 1st innings.csv`

```csv
batting_team,runs_off_bat,extras,player_dismissed,wicket_type,is_wicket,ball,start_date
Team A,1,0,,,	0,0.1,2023-02-01
Team A,4,0,,,	0,0.2,2023-02-01
Team A,0,1,,,	0,0.3,2023-02-01
Team A,6,0,,,	0,0.4,2023-02-01
Team A,0,0,some player,bowled,1,0.5,2023-02-01
Team A,2,0,,,	0,0.6,2023-02-01
```

File: `data/sa20 data/match 1001; Team A vs Team B; 2023; 2nd innings.csv`

```csv
batting_team,runs_off_bat,extras,player_dismissed,wicket_type,is_wicket,ball,start_date
Team B,2,0,,,	0,0.1,2023-02-01
Team B,1,0,,,	0,0.2,2023-02-01
Team B,4,0,,,	0,0.3,2023-02-01
Team B,0,1,,,	0,0.4,2023-02-01
Team B,6,0,,,	0,0.5,2023-02-01
Team B,0,0,another player,caught,1,0.6,2023-02-01
```

Once added, run the app and you should see one match (`Team A vs Team B (2023)`) in the list.

## 🧾 Example Output (Snippet)

The narrative is generated with slight randomness, so wording may vary. A typical output looks like:

```
====================================================================================================
BETWAY SA20 LEAGUE 2023 : Team A vs Team B                            
====================================================================================================

MATCH SUMMARY:                            
====================================================================================================
Team A managed to put 14 on the board, losing 1 wickets in their 20 overs. It was a fighting total, built on partnerships rather than individual brilliance.

In reply, Team B made light work of the chase, reaching the target with 9 wickets in hand. The batsmen were in complete control, never letting the required run rate get out of hand and finishing the game with plenty of deliveries to spare.

The match featured several momentum shifts, with both teams having their moments of dominance.  This dominant display from Team B sends a strong message to their rivals, proving they are serious contenders for the title this season.

====================================================================================================
SCORECARD:                            
====================================================================================================
1st Innings: Team A

```

## ✅ Testing

This project includes a small `pytest` suite.
